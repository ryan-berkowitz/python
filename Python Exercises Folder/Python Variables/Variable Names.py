#The rules of Python variables:
#First rule: We don't talk about Python variables
#Second rule: We don't talk about Python variables
#...jk......

#A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
#A variable name cannot start with a number
#A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _)
#Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age, and AGE are three different variables)

#Examples of illegal variable names: 2myvar, my-var, my var

#Camel Case
myVariableName = "John"

#Pascal Case
MyVariableName2 = "John"

#Snake Case
my_variable_name = "John"
